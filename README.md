## About

Kraken Plugins is a suite of installable plugins fully compatible with RuneLite that extend your client's capabilities beyond RuneLite's restrictive plugin approval process. Built on top of RuneLite, Kraken enables new overlays for bosses, skilling, and PvP that help you tackle the content you're interested in.

### What Can Kraken Plugins Do?

- 🎯 **Boss Mechanics**: Show Olm's current rotation, Sotetseg maze paths, correct tiles for insanity Wardens, projectile splatter locations for Araxxor and so much more!
- ⚒️ **Quality of Life**: Large, clickable interfaces for smithing and other skills
- ⚔️ **Automation Helpers**: Automatic prayer switching, gear swaps, spell casting, thrall summons, and more
- 🎨 **Enhanced Overlays**: Visual aids designed to help with in-game tasks rather than fully automate them

Kraken's plugins are mostly overlay-based, providing a middle ground between standard RuneLite plugins and full automation, which drastically reduces ban risk while still offering powerful assistance.
